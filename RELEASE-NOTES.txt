RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).

Changes since last release
===========================

--- New features ---

   * Dynamic WSDL generation, query via http://[HOST]:[PORT]/[WEBAPP_NAME]/wsdl, e.g. http://localhost:8080/52n-sos-webapp-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT/wsdl
   * InsertSensor: 
       * for more than one offering
       * again for another offering
       * again for the same offering if the procedure was deleted before, observations inserted before deletion are not provided

--- Changes ---

  * Database model has changed: observation are not inserted twice if they relate to a different 
        offering but same procedure, observedProperty and featureOfInterest

--- Fixed bugs ---
  
   * Insert an observation again without an error.
